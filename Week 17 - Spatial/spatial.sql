    Brooklyn is having issues with a particular supergang : The rectangles.

    They focus on controlling busy points within the city and carve out a particularly shaped area of influence: 
    a rectangle. 1 point of interest, or node, is central to their operation, they control every other node within 
    750 meters.

    They only seem to settle down if a node has at least 3 other nodes within 750 of a central node and theyâ€™ve also 
    got a strange fascination with electronic stores. This means that there will be at least 4 nodes in a group.
